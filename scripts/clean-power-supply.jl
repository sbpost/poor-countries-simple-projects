    # Outline:
    # 1. Read the paths supplied in the function arguments. Join the two sources.
    # 2. Do some basic cleaning: format column types, harmonize state names, etc.
    # 3. Calculate supply shortages and return the data.

    # ============================================================== #
    # 1. Read and join the data:
    # ---------------------------

    # Read the files supplied by Allcott et al
    powersupply_df = CSV.read(
        allcott_et_al_supply_path,
        DataFrame

    # The data from Allcot et al and the data from CEA overlaps by 2 years (2009, 2010).
    # I use the data pulled from the CEA in those two years (because it
    # has been digitized by software and not transcribed by hand).
    powersupply_df = @rsubset(powersupply_df, :year < 2009)

    # Names are sloppily recorded in both the original sources (not the same across years)
    # and in the transcription of the PDFs. In addition some states changes names across
    # years. I first fix this (see the fix-states code in the src folder) and remove
    # regional groupings.
    powersupply_df = @chain powersupply_df begin

                             "Northern Region", "North-Eastern Region"]
    end

    # Some of the values in the original data has three ',' to denote large number.
    # They are used unusually, however: the CEA uses "40,000" to denote
    # fourty-thousands but also "1,40,000" to denote one hundred and forty thousands.
    # This screws up the column typing.

        @rtransform :availability_mu = fix_numeric_types(:availability_mu)
    end

    # ============================================================== #
    # 3. Calculate supply shortages and finish up:
    # ---------------------------------------------

    # Shortages are measured as the percentage of demand that is unmet:
    # That is: (Requirements - Availability) / Requirement. This means
    # that the number is positve when there is a lack of energy and is
    # negative when there is plenty energy.
